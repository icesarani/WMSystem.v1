# WMSystem.v1
Warehousing System Emulation developed in Java.
In this version we have a functional console program for WareHousing.
I am a Functional Analyst at WMS and I tried to replicate how the WMSystems like Infor works today.
Its the version 1.0 because my intetion for the future is improve it adding a conection with a database and a graphic interface.
